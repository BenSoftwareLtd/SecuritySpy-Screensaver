# SecuritySpy-Screensaver
macOS screensaver to display live video from the macOS CCTV software SecuritySpy

This is the Xcode project for the screensaver that we originally developed for our macOS CCTV software SecuritySpy.
The screensaver has been discontinued for a few years now, but we are finding there is still some demand from
users for this, so we have decided to publish the source code so that interested users can keep the project alive.
The screensaver does seem to work well on recent macOS system versions, however some of the the code does need
modernisation.
